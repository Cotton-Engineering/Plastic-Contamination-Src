# Plastic-Contamination-Src
Development of Systems to Identify and Remove Plastic Contamination From Cotton

# Machine Vision Sensor Development

Software designed to help facilitate development and testing of Real-Time machine vision control  
Current focus is on applying this software development effort as a tool to enable and support engineering   
efforts targeted for design and implementation of new systems to be used in cotton gins and on harvesters for   
detection and removal of plastic contamination from cotton processing streams.
