# Plastic Contamination Source Code
This repository holds the Software Source Code for the:  
Development of Systems to Identify and Remove Plastic Contamination From Cotton

For an over-view of the software; please see the respository: Plastic-Contamination-Notes  
where you will find an over-view video.  

For those who are unfamiliar with GitHub and QT; the Notes directory alsong includes notes   
on how to setup a QT IDE project that will automatically link in this source code repository.  

# Machine Vision Sensor Development

Software designed to help facilitate development and testing of Real-Time machine vision control  
Current focus is on applying this software development effort as a tool to enable and support engineering   
efforts targeted for design and implementation of new systems to be used in cotton gins and on harvesters for   
detection and removal of plastic contamination from cotton processing streams.
